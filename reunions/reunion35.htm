        <p align="left"><strong>The Cranston East class of 1971's 35th annual 
          Reunion took place on<br>
          </strong><strong>Saturday, September 9, at Yawgoo Bakes in Slocum, RI. 
          This was kind of an<br>
          experiment: would classmates have a good time at a Reunion that was 
          1)<br>
          outdoors 2) during the day 3) not in November 4) in casual clothes 5)<br>
          without music so loud you can't hear what people are saying 6) and<br>
          inexpensive? Based on what people told me, I'd say the answer is: Yeah!<br>
          <br>
          The day itself was perfect: summery sun, with a slight breeze to keep<br>
          cool.<br>
          Considering that it rained the week before - and was arctic the next 
          day -<br>
          we lucked out. Thanks to Whoever was in charge of the weather.<br>
          <br>
          Yawgoo Bakes is a rustic, park-like place, and includes several<br>
          roofed-but-open-sided structures, kind of like dining halls at a summer<br>
          camp. The smaller building housed the bar, which did a brisk business 
          as<br>
          </strong><strong> people arrived, checked in, put on their name tags, 
          donned their souvenir<br>
          t-shirts (mine is now a collector's item), and began talking, hugging, 
          and<br>
          laughing with people. The place also has a ball field, horseshoe pit,<br>
          volleyball net, basketball court, and bocce pitch, none of which got 
          much<br>
          use, although Joe Ricci and I played a little bocce before dinner, and 
          Tom<br>
          Iacono and Butch Butler shot some baskets.<br>
          <br>
          Dinner was served in the larger structure: barbecued selections and<br>
          lobster.<br>
          I thought the food was great, but I'm a sucker for barbecue anyway. 
          The meal<br>
          gave people more of an opportunity to meet and chat. People strolled 
          under<br>
          the trees, sat at the picnic tables.<br>
          <br>
          It brought a smile to my face to look around during the day and see 
          a dozen<br>
          groups of classmates talking, laughing, and picking up the threads. 
          I got to<br>
          talk to some old friends, continuing conversations started decades ago 
          as if<br>
          it was only yesterday. As usual, I met and spoke with some classmates 
          I'd<br>
          never known before and, as usual, was fascinated by the different<br>
          trajectories people's lives take. We talked about family and jobs and<br>
          places<br>
          to live and pets and health and everything else.<br>
          <br>
          Elliott Richman and I observed that this is a really nice bunch of people.<br>
          We're lucky to have a group of folks that are this nice, this interested 
          in<br>
          each other, this willing to travel just to say hi and make contact again.<br>
          After all, some classmates came from pretty far: North Carolina, Maryland,<br>
          Colorado, Florida, California, Bermuda (hi, Roberta!), just to mention 
          a<br>
          few. It's too bad we only get to do this every five years or so.<br>
          <br>
          As far as the turnout, we had about a hundred classmates, plus guests,which<br>
          is not bad, considering that we only have good contact information on 
          about<br>
          400 classmates, half of whom live out of state. I know that some folks 
          opted<br>
          out because they prefer a dinner-dance type format. I personally don't 
          mind<br>
          either way, but it was nice to wear comfortable clothes, and wander 
          around<br>
          the trees and grass, and talk to people like at a big picnic.<br>
          <br>
          So many people thanked me so enthusiastically that I have to clarify 
          my<br>
          minor role: keeping track of contact information, and sending out emails 
          and<br>
          occasional mailings. All the real work was done by others. A committee 
          of<br>
          the willing made phone calls, gave suggestions, offered opinions, and 
          helped<br>
          in many other ways: thanks to Juliana Pastine Reilly, Ernie Rheaume, 
          Gail<br>
          Glen Whitfield, Teddy DeCaro, Gene Blair, Helen Dittelman Dolan, Ed 
          Ianni,<br>
          Maryann Pezza Matano, John Dyer, Pat Dewey Giarusso, Tina DeMarcoMcKendall,<br>
          and Susan Bond Burns. Dan Barry fronted the deposit money and helped 
          us with<br>
          suggestions from his long experience. Paula Zampini-Capozzi made a<br>
          thoughtful donation, even though she could not attend. Joyce Singer 
          Lee made<br>
          many phone calls, arranged publicity, and put up signs, among other 
          things.<br>
          Monika Szynkarski Curnett handled all the money transactions superbly,<br>
          despite irregular and cryptic information from me. Beverly Brisson DeFelice<br>
          helped distribute t-shirts and provided a fascinating scrapbook of our 
          last<br>
          get-together. And, finally, I solemnly promised Nancy Goldis Iacono 
          that I<br>
          would not mention how she handled all the arrangements with Yawgoo Bakes,<br>
          designed and ordered all the t-shirts, ordered and obtained desserts 
          and<br>
          decorations, and without whom there simply wouldn't have been a reunion, 
          so,<br>
          of course, I won't.<br>
