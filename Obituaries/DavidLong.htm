<p>David Jesse Long Dec. 11, 1952 - Dec 7, 2017</p>

<p>David Jesse Long, age 64 of Jamestown, RI, passed away peacefully on December 07, 2017 surrounded by his family. David grew up in Cranston, RI, the fourth of Jesse and Shirley Long&rsquo;s five children. At age 2, he contracted polio which resulted in life-long complications.&nbsp; When he was housebound as a child, he discovered a talent for music. Although he never learned to read music, David possessed the rare ability to teach himself to play a large array of instruments from piano, ukulele, recorder to flute. This innate passion and skill for music of all kinds continued to grow and develop throughout his life.</p>

<p>After graduating from Cranston East High School in 1971, David moved to Washington DC where he performed for over a decade with the bands Growing Up Different and Face Dancer. He was not only an accomplished musician, he was also a standup comedian and storyteller.</p>

<p>In the 80&rsquo;s, David returned to Jamestown where he had spent summers with his family. Here, he became a pillar of the Island community. He served for many years on the Town Council, was an active member of the library board and could often be found playing piano and serenading the crowd at Trattoria Simpatico.</p>

<p>While David&rsquo;s life consisted of many different chapters, the greatest period began when he met his soulmate and partner-in-crime, Dana. Together they built an incredible life full of love, laughter and joy. David&rsquo;s greatest pride in life was raising his twin daughters to become exceptional young women.</p>

<p>David was happiest when he was surrounded by family and friends. He was a devoted father, a loving husband, brother, son and uncle. Above all, he was an unparalleled friend. He is survived by his wife Dana; daughters Jesse and Sofie; brother Ron and his wife Mary; brother Stephen and his wife Terry; brother Paul and his wife Alberta; sister Debbie and her husband Don; many cousins, nieces and nephews; in-laws the Kenney Family; his beloved dog, Ava, and cat, Tux.</p>
