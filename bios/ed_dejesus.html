        <font size="2">3/17/03</font></font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"><font size="2">Hi, 

        everybody! I assume you're REALLY bored, if you're reading this...</font></font> 

      </p>

      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">After graduation, 

        I went to URI, originally majoring in engineering. I quickly realized 

        that engineering had way too many required courses, so I switched to the 

        major with the absolute fewest required courses: math.<br>

        (Lesson: You can't plan everything. Be flexible.) When I got my bachelor's 

        degree in math, I switched again, to physics, and got my master's in 1977. 

        Most important classes taken: sailing and Shakespeare.</font></p>

      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At the time, 

        the only physics jobs available were in nuclear weapons design, so I went 

        to work for IBM in Newport as a computer programmer. (Lesson: I can get 

        jobs that, strictly speaking, I have no qualifications for.) IBM had a 

        contract with the Navy to write software for the Trident submarine. I 

        wrote code to help submarines not bump into things, like enemy torpedoes. 

        I didn't really approve of the Trident program: at the same time I was 

        working on this project, I was also actively protesting the building of 

        the Trident. Go figure.</font></p>

      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">After 3 or 

        4 years, I suddenly remembered that I wasn't a computer programmer, but 

        a physicist. My goal was to stay in IBM, but move to a job with more physics. 

        IBM at that time had more money than it knew what to do with. Employee 

        benefits were lavish. It was like a big, world-wide club. I thought my 

        chances for physics opportunities would be better if I got my PhD, so 

        I started taking courses part-time to finish my degree. (Lesson: Planning 

        your life is like pushing a rope.)</font></p>

      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 1982, 

        I went to a Fourth of July house party, invited by a guy I knew slightly 

        who lived at the house. I met the most beautiful woman I've ever known. 

        Bam! I was in love. I managed to spend as much time with her at the party 

        as I could. Her name was Ellie McConnaughy, and she was smart and fun 

        and nice. Two days later I asked her out on a date. We've been together 

        ever since. (Lesson: Accept all invitations.)</font></p>

      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Shortly afterwards, 

        Ellie moved to New Haven for a year's experience as a research psychologist 

        at a VA hospital. We commuted back and forth on weekends to see each other.</font></p>

      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 1983, 

        I took a leave of absence from IBM to finish my doctorate. Ellie moved 

        back to RI and finished up her doctorate. In 1984, Ellie had the opportunity 

        for a two-year post-doctorate with a researcher she'd always wanted to 

        work with. At Vanderbilt University. In Nashville, Tennessee. Gulp. We 

        moved to Nashville, and I got a job teaching math and computers at a nearby 

        state college (Middle Tennessee State University, in Murfreesboro).</font></p>

      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We liked 

        Tennessee. The weather was nice. The people were incredibly friendly. 

        Of course, it was a little farther from the ocean than I prefer. And there 

        was a bit of a language barrier, with my students understanding me and 

        me understanding my students. We traveled around the area, to Atlanta, 

        Louisville, Lexington, and the Smoky Mountains. (Lesson: I can probably 

        live anywhere in the US, especially if catfish is available.)</font></p>

      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 1985, 

        Ellie and I got married, back in RI, where most of our family and friends 

        were. I also got my doctorate that year, after a mighty struggle: I had 

        to do my dissertation defense three times before I passed. (Lesson: It's 

        not a bad idea to find out how people are going to evaluate you before 

        you get evaluated.)</font></p>

      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 1986, 

        we moved back to New England, and settled in Norwood, MA to be near Boston 

        and jobs. Ellie worked as a therapist at several clinics before starting 

        her own private practice. We bought a house in Norwood in 1987.</font></p>

      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I taught 

        basic science at Boston University from 1986-1990. I didn't like it much. 

        The students were too privileged and snotty. I took a job as a researcher 

        at MIT Lincoln Labs in Lexington. Analyzing the trajectories of Soviet 

        ballistic missile tests, if you can believe it. I was relieved to get 

        laid off in 1993. (Lesson: Unemployment is God's way of telling you to 

        stop working on defense.)</font></p>

      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Our first 

        child, James, was born in 1990. Yikes! Parenthood is quite an<br>

        experience: both joyful and fulfilling, and exhausting and frustrating. 

        Our second child, Katie, was born in 1992. Our kids are really the core 

        of our lives. Most of what we do revolves around providing a good and 

        safe home, and all the love and support we can. I occasionally want to 

        throttle them, like when they give me a hard time when I'm trying to help 

        them with their homework. But there are moments that are simply wonderful, 

        like seeing Katie do well at a swim meet, or watching James acting in 

        a play. (Lesson: Kids are good. Who knew?)</font></p>

      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">After my 

        blissful unemployment in 1993, I went freelance, helping high-tech companies 

        write and test software, conducting training on technical topics, and 

        producing documentation. (Lesson: I don't have to work for other people. 

        I can make it on my own without much difficulty.)</font></p>

      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On the basis 

        of one product review I wrote for them, I got a job as an editor with 

        prestigious BYTE magazine in 1994. I rapidly had to learn how to write 

        and edit articles for a global magazine. Despite the way this bio sounds, 

        I got the hang of it, and wrote a bunch of articles and cover stories 

        for the magazine. BYTE went belly-up in 1998. My cover story on the coming 

        Y2K problem appeared on the final issue.</font></p>

      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 1992, 

        Ellie and I started going to church again. We had been members of the 

        largest unorganized religion in the world, lapsed Catholics, but we felt 

        we needed something more, especially if we wanted our children to experience 

        religious thought. We attended a Unitarian church for a while, but it 

        took us about six months to deduce that the minister believed in God. 

        (I now think of Unitarianism as Religion Lite, a kind of halfway house 

        for people abused by their religion of origin.) In 1995, Ellie began attending 

        a church she found, and I went with her once. I was appalled. People were 

        singing and clapping and calling things out. Very unruly. These people 

        were Christians, with a capital C, and had a very strange set of beliefs. 

        Still, Ellie liked it, so I went with her. I even started attending an 

        informal class one night a week. I questioned the poor teacher mercilessly, 

        tearing apart everything she was trying to present. I was extremely skeptical 

        about the whole thing. Strangely, out of my skepticism, I developed certain 

        beliefs, or rather realized that I did believe certain things. After a 

        long period of thought and study, I became a Christian. Technically, I 

        am a born-again Christian. Not like those morons you see on TV, who embarrass 

        the life out of me. This is a tough religion: anything that starts out 

        with &quot;love your enemies&quot; is not easy. But it has really changed 

        my life. I know that some people have spiritual experiences, but I don't, 

        or at least not the same kind. For me, Christianity gives perspective 

        to my life and to the world.</font></p>

      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">After the 

        demise of BYTE, I again turned freelance. I have written lots of articles 

        for lots of magazines (try doing a Google search on Edmund DeJesus: yikes). 

        I have done contract work for lots of high-tech companies, like EMC, CardScan, 

        FutureTense (now history), and Baltimore Technologies. After my contract 

        ended with Baltimore, they made me an offer I couldn't refuse to become 

        an actual employee. I'm still with them (as of 2003). It's kind of nice 

        having paid benefits and actual vacation days.</font></p>

      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">My life right 

        now:<br>

        We still live in Norwood, MA. Ellie has a part-time private practice as 

        a therapist, which she enjoys. She also devotes her time to several local 

        projects, like a town anti-bullying committee. She's interested in developing 

        her public speaking skills. She is a voracious reader and usually has 

        a couple dozen books lined up to tackle. She loves to try out new recipes 

        and I am an enthusiastic guinea pig. We try to go out at least a couple 

        of times a month for little dates. I'm lucky to have her.</font></p>

      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">James is 

        becoming a teenager, in years and behavior. He plays percussion in the 

        junior high band. He loves acting, especially games and exercises in improv. 

        He is very funny and original. He's perfectly relaxed onstage, which I 

        find amazing. He is totally uninterested in anything that involves physical 

        activity, and prefers to play Magic cards (if you don't know, don't even 

        ask). It is fun to have a son I can introduce to the things I've always 

        enjoyed. We like the same kinds of movies, mainly, and love seeing things 

        like the Star Wars or Ring movies or Spiderman together.</font></p>

      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Katie is 

        a dynamo, with more energy than the rest of us put together. She finds 

        it hard to sit still for more than about 30 seconds, and does her homework 

        as if she were traversing an obstacle course. She is the tallest girl 

        in her elementary school (thanks to Ellie's side of the family), which 

        helps her stand out, but she's also beautiful: I am already looking at 

        brochures for nice convents for her. She is a good singer and is in the 

        town chorus. It's been really wonderful for me, a guy, to have a daughter, 

        especially one as sweet and sensitive as she is. A few weeks ago, I heard 

        her crying in her room. When I went to see what was wrong, she looked 

        up from the book she was reading for school and said simply, &quot;Winnie 

        dies.&quot; Broke my heart.</font></p>

      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I continue 

        to write articles for magazines, mainly about computer topics, but I'm 

        trying to write about science also. I don't think I'll ever get back to 

        working in physics. Still, I love to read about astrophysics and particle 

        physics and all that bizarre stuff that has nothing and everything to 

        do with everyday life. I'm also trying to get some of my fiction writing 

        published. I've published a short story and some poems, and self-published 

        a mystery novel. I enjoy writing. I don't get to sail much, but love it 

        when I do. I've found I enjoy learning about military strategy for some 

        odd reason, and I'm working my way diligently through the Age of Empires 

        computer game scenarios. </font></p>

      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Last summer, 

        I had to have heart surgery to repair a congenital valve problem. It was 

        quite an experience to surrender myself to undergo something that I might 

        not survive. It was also daunting to have to go through weeks of recovery 

        when just walking to the corner is a real challenge: it's hard to be so 

        incapable and vulnerable. It was a real eye-opener for me. I learned that 

        I can surrender, and be weak, and be vulnerable, yet still survive, still 

        be a man, a husband, a father. I will try to remember that twenty and 

        thirty and forty years from now. (I'm perfectly healthy now: I've never 

        been in such good shape.)</font></p>

      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I don't think 

        I ever really had a plan for my life, but even if I did, I know it hasn't 

        gone according to any plan I could have devised. Who would have foreseen 

        meeting Ellie? Who knew that I'd end up earning my living by writing, 

        of all things? Who would have anticipated what having children would be 

        like? It's all a surprise to me.</font></p>
