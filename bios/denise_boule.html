<H3>Advisory culture offers hope</H3>
<B><BR>
</B>With state and municipal budget crises whittling away at schools and
federal accountability bearing down without let up, three Rhode Island high
schools are betting that advisories or student mentoring are key to making
dramatic improvement in our mostly factory-model secondary schools. These
are high schools, mind you, and if they can become more humanized, surely
the sad, stalled-out middle schools will be able to follow suit.<BR>
<BR>
Dan Warner, vice principal at Narragansett High, is so psyched to have small
groups of kids attached to an adult, he states unequivocally that &quot;advisories
are finally the vehicle we'll use to make change successful at the secondary
level. It's a structure that actually supports kids.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Warner came from a University of Colorado lab school where advisories were
&quot;the glue that held everything together. They informed school improvement;
they were the community-building tool; they were the connection between
school and home, teacher to teacher, student to the real world.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
He's not the only one that sounds like a religious convert.<BR>
<BR>
North Kingstown High School Vice Principal Patti DiCenso, wanted to talk
with me a second time, because upon reflection she felt I needed to understand
that a school just starting advisories should take it just as slow as they
like. Just getting to know the kids is a huge cultural shift. By all means
have an advisory curriculum to lean on, but it's more important to settle
into the relationships and let it evolve into something with more structure.<BR>
<BR>
<strong>Denise Boule, Principal of Exeter-West Greenwich High School -- and this 
year's principal of the year -- has a cautious, measured temperament, but even 
she is impressed with how improved all levels of communication have become with 
advisories. Exeter-West Greenwich's program is now three years old and getting 
all manner of information to the school community just gets easier and easier. 
Daily, teachers approach an adviser to get help with a struggling student. Kid 
issues are no longer a huge mystery.</strong><BR>
<BR>
DiCenso tells this story: A teacher who is a very good subject-matter teacher,
but old-school in her thinking, had strenuously resisted the implementation
of advisories. Now she had a group of ninth graders to tend. One very shy,
upset girl confessed that she couldn't stand going to her science class
because the bruiser who sat next to her made fun of her. No, she couldn't
tell the science teacher because she was too frightened. To grownups this
is a no-brainer, so the two teachers had a brief conversation and moved
her seat. The girl began to thrive. Subsequently, the teacher came down
to the principal and said: That's it. I'm a believer. Getting the kid's
seat moved made a huge difference. She would have cried at home, hated school
and let her academics suffer.<BR>
<BR>
Someone knew a little fact about that kid and bothered to do something about
it.<BR>
<BR>
DiCenso says: &quot;Most high school kids take their heads off and leave
their feelings at the school door, come in and are not whole kids. Then
we the adults get all bogged down in more and more programs to address the
lack of relationships or how poor the school climate is.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Who likes the advisories the best, right off the bat, are the ninth graders
who finally have a place to attach when they otherwise would have been batting
around one of our large, intimidating high schools. Rather than freaking
out about the little things that set off adolescents, students can go de-stress
with an adviser every day for 10, 12, 15 minutes. Ninth grade is by far
the biggest contributor to Rhode Island's 19 percent drop-out rate, so those
trying to get that rate down to 0, take note.<BR>
<BR>
<strong>Boule feels advisories -- along with block scheduling -- are big-time 
contributors to the calming of her building, but also, to a lesser extent, to 
the slow, ongoing reduction of her dropout rate. Her first advisories specifically 
targeted those seniors at risk of not graduating. As the program has grown and 
the adults know so much more about the kids, the school's staff has more opportunity 
to intervene early with struggling students, preventing them from getting close 
to failing senior year. And if a ninth grader does not pass enough classes to 
matriculate to the 10th grade, that student can stay with her advisory, since 
the relationship with the teacher and the group are what's important.<BR>
<BR>
Boule developed various techniques for helping her school community achieve the 
staff comfort level that all three administrators concede is the biggest hurdle 
to implementation. As a resolution to a union grievance, Exeter-West Greenwich 
labor and management wrote a mission statement to clarify that the adviser is 
not a guidance counselor, nor assumed to have their training, and advisories replace 
no guidance jobs. The mission statement reads:<BR>
<BR>
&quot;The Adviser/Advisee program provides the student with an adult in the school 
to whom she/he can turn to for assistance in making adjustments to school, making 
decisions and developing a sense of belonging. The Adviser will also be able to 
assist with choices in academics and in future plans that meet the student's needs, 
interests, background and goals.&quot;<BR>
</strong><BR>
Every ninth grader at Exeter-West Greenwich gets a copy of the Seven Habits
of Highly Effective Teens, which creates a common vocabulary among all parties
at the school. Each adviser gets a list of academic skills, personal management
skills and teamwork skills that could be discussed, and schedule of essential
questions which must at least be raised during certain two week periods.
Each grade level has a list of key concepts for their year like, for example,
the ninth grade focus on study styles and skills, teacher styles, personal
management, social and academic expectations and homework.<BR>
<BR>
Did anyone talk to you about this stuff in the ninth grade? Other than your
mother, to whom you paid little or no mind?<BR>
<BR>
Advisories will not take care of badly needed curriculum revisions, nor
repair aging buildings, nor boost ailing budgets. They are not the silver
bullet. But they are real close. Small groups of kids talking to a school
professional can resolve an astounding amount of heretofore ignored issues.<BR>
<BR>
As a Rhode Island chauvinist, I'd like every Rhode Island secondary student,
especially the urban kids, to be mentored by next fall. The state as a whole
would get better results by giving every student a bit of our most precious
resource, the teachers.<BR>
